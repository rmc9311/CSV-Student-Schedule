How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

    Answer: This project has helped me understand the use of databases and the importance of knowing what information you will be funneling into those databases. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    Answer: While I was working on this project I realized that great importance of using comments as well as making your code readable. As I was adding to my program the ability for it to be adabtile was extremely important. If it wasn't then I would struggling adding in parts of code that were essential for my program to pass the tests.
